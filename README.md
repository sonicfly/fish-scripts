# fish-scripts

Some fish function scripts I used personally.

## Content
Including commands:
* __,__ - _ls -lphG_
* __,,__ - _ls -alphG_
* __fish\_prompt__ - _Very simple fish prompt_
* __cdnow__ - _A quick **cd** command to go to pre-defined paths_

## Installation
Put all files into __~/.config/fish/__ folder or add this ./functions folder location to __$fish\_function\_path__ environment variable.
